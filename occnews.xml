<p><strong>Bhubaneswar: </strong>A day after the holy trinity adorned the golden attire, it is time for observing the ‘Adhara Pana’ ritual, wherein, a rich drink will be offered to the trinity by priests today.</p>



<p>It is believed that the deities are tired with the journey during Bahuda and then when they also got ready to give their devotees a special darshan of their ‘<a href="https://www.odisha360.com/2019/07/13/rath-yatra-2019-lakhs-of-devotees-thong-to-puri-for-suna-besha-of-lord-jagannath/">Suna Besha</a>’, they become extremely tired.</p>



<p>The “Pana” is made of a mixture of milk cream, cheese, sugar, banana, camphor, nuts, black pepper apart from various herbal plant extracts, including tulasi that are blended into the drink.</p>



<p>The beverage is then filled in nine earthen pots. The pots are long cylindrical shaped so that they reach the height of the deities’ lips. The deities are offered three pots each. After consecrating, the pots are smashed right there on the chariots, so that the drink flows all over the chariot.</p>

<p>Hera Panchami is observed on the fifth day of the <a href="https://www.odisha360.com/2019/07/04/rath-yatra-2019-lakhs-of-devotees-throng-to-puri-to-witness-rath-yatra/">rath yatra</a>. The rituals of this day have special significance in the nine-day festival.</p>



<p>On this day, Goddess Lakshmi, wife of Lord Jagannath, pays a visit to him at the Gundicha temple to request him to come back to the Jagannath temple.</p>



<p>To represent Goddess Lakshmi, the idol of Subarna Mahalakshmi is carried to the Gundicha temple from the Jagannath temple on a palanquin in a grand procession by the servitors. The priests at the Gundicha temple receive the goddess and felicitate her after which she is escorted to the sanctum.</p>



<p>But while returning in the evening, following the goddess’ wish, one of her servitors breaks a portion of the Nandighosha (Lord Jagannath’s chariot), which is known as the Ratha Bhanga Neeti.</p>
